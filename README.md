Course 1 - Week 2
- Graphical and numerical interpretations for one variable (univariate data). 
- Creating and analyzing histograms, box plots, and numerical summaries of data in order to give a basis of analysis for quantitative data and bar charts and pie charts for categorical data. 
- Making a few key interpretations about numerical summaries such as mean, IQR, and standard deviation.

Course 1 - Week 3
- Key ideas for examining research questions that require looking at more than one variable. 
- Considerinng both numerically and visually how different variables interact, how summaries can appear deceiving if you donâ€™t properly account for interactions, and differences between quantitative and categorical variables.

Course 2 - Week 2
- Estimating population parameters via confidence intervals. 
- Using five different types of population parameters, assumptions needed to calculate a confidence interval for each of these five parameters, and how to calculate confidence intervals.

Course 2 - Week 3
- Test various hypotheses - using the five different analysis methods. 
- Discuss the importance of various factors and assumptions with hypothesis testing and interpreting the results. 
- Review how to distinguish which procedure is appropriate for the research question at hand.

Course 3 - Week 2
- Basics of two types of regression: linear regression and logistic regression. 
- Think about how to fit models, how to assess how well those models fit, and to consider how to interpret those models in the context of the data. 
- Implement those models within Python.

Course 3 - Week 3
- Multilevel and marginal models enable researchers to account for dependencies in variables of interest introduced by study designs. 
- Why and when to fit these alternative models, likelihood ratio tests, as well as fixed effects and their interpretations.
